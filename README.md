## The project

You will build a small full stack app with Django and React.
The goal is to be able to use all CRUD operations in a simple webapp for the translation objects.<br>
A translation object is a simple object consisting of the attributes:

| Attribute  | Datatype |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Id         | Integer  |
| InputText  | String   |
| OutputText | String   |

You have to implement the following functions in the front and back end:

1. create a new translation object
2. update an existing translation
3. Read one translation object
4. Read all translation objects
5. Delete a translation object
